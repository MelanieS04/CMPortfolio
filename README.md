Portfolio for Computational Musicology

Corpus idea:
Compare multiple albums of John Mayer and see if his older or newer music is more popular, and how come? Are there any outliers? 
-	Compare some of his older albums to his newer albums
-	Are the most popular songs more based on the technical guitar skills? Or are the most popular songs easier to play and easy to listen to and because of that also more accessible to a bigger crowd?


Useable Spotify features:
-	Instrumentalness
-	Speechiness
-	Energy
-	Danceability
-	Valence
-	Key
-	Mode
-	(Time signature)
-	Tempo


Preliminary findings:

Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to get the album information. I tried to get the album data in R, however it kept showing an error and I could not figure out what I did wrong here. Even though I was unable to get the right information, I do have some expectations of the album data. For example, in the album continuum I would expect the instrumentalness of most of the songs to be fairly high compared to some other albums, because there are guitar solos in almost every song on the album. I would also expect this to be maybe the most popular album of them all, because two of the songs of this album are also in the top five on his Spotify artist page. However, I would expect the danceability of the tracks on this album to be fairly low, because, to me, this album does not seem as danceable as some of his other songs and albums. Besides this, danceability does not really seem to be the purpose of this album. Because I could not get R to work properly, I was unable to find any outliers here.
